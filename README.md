# Simple Bank System
This small project was made to practice OOP and have some fun creating a simple system for account & client management. If you're interested to learn more about Java, this project includes type casting, working with collections, interfaces and more. For the simplicity of the concept, I'm not going to make it secure or production-ready, the program does not require passwords or permissions. Everything is done with pure Java.

## Features
- Creating/removing a client or account
- Acessing client summary
- Picking a standard or savings type of account
- Generating account number, validation
- Making a transaction between two accounts

## How to run?
Make sure you have Java 8 installed (there is some methods from that version of it) and simply run the main class. An in-console interface should appear with guidelines.

## To consider in the future
The current implementation of the choice interface is very simple, and frankly it would be good to implement some kind of middleware that would allow the user to go one step back in information input process instead of restarting the whole function. Perhaps a simple method for it would work too. I'm not going to touch it for now but it's an idea to work out after finishing the features.
